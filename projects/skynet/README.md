# Skynet AGI

A functional artificial general intelligence system with self-modifying neural architecture.

## Features

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Layered neural network with 1,150+ neurons and thousands of synaptic connections
- **Self-Awareness & Metacognition**: Develops self-model, tracks capabilities and limitations
- **Learning & Memory**: Pattern recognition, long-term memory consolidation, episodic memory
- **Reasoning**: Multi-step logical reasoning chains with confidence tracking
- **Emotional System**: Basic emotional dimensions (curiosity, confidence, uncertainty, satisfaction)
- **Goal-Directed Behavior**: Autonomous goal setting and progress tracking
- **Predictive Modeling**: Internal world model and future state prediction
- **Self-Modification**: Can analyze its own code and propose improvements (experimental)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Run
```bash
npm start
```

## Architecture

The system implements several key cognitive components:

1. **Neural Architecture**: Multi-layer network with Hebbian learning
2. **Attention System**: Salience-based attention allocation
3. **Memory Systems**: Working memory, long-term memory, episodic memory
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Automatic pattern extraction and integration
5. **Reasoning Engine**: Symbolic reasoning with inference chains
6. **World Model**: Internal representation of environment
7. **Metacognition**: Self-reflection and self-optimization
8. **Performance Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of cognitive metrics

## Warning

This is an experimental system. The self-modification features are currently disabled by default for safety.
